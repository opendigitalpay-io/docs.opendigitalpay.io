## Introduction
Payment system is complex and difficult to be built properly. Especially the system needs to be designed to be easily extensible and scalable to support fast-growing businesses. It’s even harder.

We are a group of engineers who have designed and implemented one of the world’s largest mobile payment systems. We would like to share our experience and provide a reference implementation of a scalable mobile payment system through opendigitalpay.io. 

Opendigitalpay.io provides an open source implementation of a mobile payment system. The core system has the following features:
* Topup: It allows customers to topup balances from various funding sources.
* Pay: It allows customers to pay from balance accounts or external payment channels, e.g. credit cards.
* Payout: It also manages the payout of merchants on your platform. 

Any companies that want to help their merchants to accept payments in their mobile apps could launch their payment system in a quick and effective manager. For example, below are some types of companies that can get benefit of opendigitalpay.io:
* Ecommerce platform
* Food delivery 
* Ride sharing
